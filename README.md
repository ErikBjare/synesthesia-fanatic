Synesthesia Fanatic
=============

Chrome extension that gives every character a specific color as if the viewer had synesthesia.

####*"Who in their right mind would use such a thing?!"*
Well, this project was inspired by the paper [*"Pseudo-Synesthesia through Reading Books with Colored Letters"*](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0039799) by Olympia Colizoli, et al. This was just to see whether we could replicate their findings by more convenient means than reading custom print books.


##Installation

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Enable developer mode and click `Load unpacked extension...` and choose to the Source directory.
